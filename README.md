## The brief
(Acceptance Criteria) The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two PLAYERS in the game (X and O) i.e. Player1 & Player2
* Players take TURNS until the GAME_IS_OVER
* A player can CLAIM_A_FIELD if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player WINS if they claim all the fields in a ROW, COLUMN or DIAGONAL; (else other player LOSES)
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when ALL_FIELDS_ARE_TAKEN
**Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.**
